# Practical Workshop on Agile Software Development

The course will focus on practical experience sharing about agile software development methodology and detail day-to-day implementation of one of the agile methodologies i.e. SCRUM as well as step by step workshop on agile software development using a real-world implementation of a system.

### Objectives of the workshop 
At the end of the course, trainees will have understanding, experience and knowledge of how American and European IT companies develop applications and be able to develop one using the same methodology and technology stack.

### Executive Summary of the workshop

The course will focus on practical experience sharing about agile software development methodology and detail day-to-day implementation of one of the agile methodologies: SCRUM. Then, introduction to Git version control system will follow with the purpose of acquainting trainees to the main features provided. Once students have a base on Git, we will develop an API using Spring Boot framework and Postgres database will be the next topic. Afterwards, we will develop a web application using ReactJS and Javascript, and a Hybrid (Android and iOS) mobile application using Flutter SDK and Dart programming language.

The course will be given in a practical way by developing a web and a mobile-based application using the recommended design patterns for developing APIs. The application we will develop is a simple money transfer system with features, which are common on most applications such as registering, logging in, sending money and listing the current balance and all transactions. Finally, this applications will be deployed to a cloud server called Heroku. 

Trainees will be divided into agile teams and will work on the project with high level of support from the instructor. Training on how to use Git distributed version control system and GitHub.com, Trello project management, Travis CI (continious intergration) as well as Heroku deployment platform will also be given.

At the end of the course, trainees will have experience and knowledge of how a system is developed in agile based software companies you know in Silicon Valley, Europe and all over the world.

### Required Resources
Every trainee should have a computer (preferably a high performance laptop) with high speed internet connection to install the required application packages. These are: 
- SDKMAN (http://sdkman.io/)
- Spring Boot (via sdkman)
- NodeJs and NPM
- ReactJS
- Flutter SDK
- IntelliJ or Eclipse IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
